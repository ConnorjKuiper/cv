    other descriptions that can be put in the HTML attribute position of the tag.  They can be used to tell the browser how to render or display the

          also give the search engines more of an idea about what the webpage is about.  Using a URL source will mean that the server must be pinged in order
          for it to get permission to display the image.  The browser then has to download it.  In order to get rid of this reliance, you can put the image
          in the same folder as the HTML file and reference it from there, because they're on the same level.-->

            The same duality is between the strong tag and the bold tag.  The strong tag conveys more information.  The a tag is referred to as the anchor
            tag.  It is used to link another text document or webpage or anything else to the current webpage.  HREF stands for hyperlink reference; you
